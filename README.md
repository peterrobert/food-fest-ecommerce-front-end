# React Ecommerce Application

> The aim of this project is to create an ecommerce application that utilises an api created in ruby on rails. At the moment the user can see the products add the product to a cart and show the product display page. Since this is a small application i didnt use redux but just utilised the power of react context. I plan on intergrating stripe as a payment system and mpesa API.
